    #### ABX Demo

    This is a demo listening test showing how ABX listening tests app works from the listener's perspective.

    In this listening test you'll be given three different options with different compression methods
    and your task is to choose your preferred option. There are two different clips with 10 iterations
    each. This is an AB test. ABX tests where the listener needs to tell if sample X is the same as
    sample A or sample B. Greater number of sample options is supported although it's recommended to
    keep the number relatively low to avoid overloading the listener.

    You'll see your results at the end. It would also be possible to have the test send the results to
    the researcher by supplying an email in the configuration file but this test does not do so. The form
    below is an example of what can be done to gather statistics about the different demographics. The
    email sent to the research would also include the form data.

    - name: Age
