    #### Mashup Evaluation

    In the following survey, you will be prompted with three different mashups, all of which use the same songs.
    You are allowed to listen to whichever sample you want for however long you want, and then are asked to select
    your favorite song. Let the two key tenets that guide your choices be quality and creativity, *equally*.
